## Conclusion
Let’s get started on learning about some of PyCharm's built-in features. We recommend starting with [creating a git repository](https://dlee.ca/user-documentation/docs/task1/) first _before_ moving onto [adding, committing and pushing your code to GitHub](https://dlee.ca/user-documentation/docs/task3/). [Creating a unit test file](https://dlee.ca/user-documentation/docs/task2/) can be done at any time.
