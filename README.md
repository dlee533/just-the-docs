# JetBrains PyCharm IDE Documentation

## Introduction
JetBrains Pycharm IDE Documentation was written as a collaborative effort between Amy Tan and Mina Lee to help the students and developers new to the IDE automate their development process. 

## Processes
Our first step in the creation of this document was to pick which features we wanted to focus on. We decided on focusing on the version control and unit testing features of the IDE because both of them are useful to know about regardless of what kind of program you are writing.

Using our experience from using the PyCharm IDE in our studies, we broke down each task into the simplest possible collection of instructions before moving on to creating our markdown files. For each step, a screenshot is provided to guide the users in finding the correct menus and buttons that must be clicked as well as show them what they should see as they go through the guide. In some of the instructions, notes with important tips are provided in order to help reduce any possible errors the user might run into. Many of these tips are taken from our personal experience working with the PyCharm IDE.

Our last steps were creating the glossary and troubleshooting sections of the document. Although it is expected that readers already have basic knowledge about version control and unit testing, we still included some key terms in case they need a reminder. In our troubleshooting section, we included a few common problems with solutions that we have encountered in our experience working with PyCharm.

## Conclusion
We hope that this document will help both current and future users of the PyCharm IDE with utilizing its built-in features.
