## Famous Quotes

This first quote, from late physicist [Stephan Hawking](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/stephen_hawking_109983?src=t_computers), compares computer viruses with life.

> I think computer viruses should count as life. I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. We've created life in our own image.

## Cats

When I was still living in Vancouver, our neighbour's Maine Coon cat would always come to our backyard and sit on the stairs. She was very open to being petted and had an incredible amount of fur. Almost every sunny day, she'd be there on the stairs when I arrived home from school.

### Conciseness Helps Web Readers

As a web reader, we want to quickly find the information we want and it should be simple and easy to understand. When information becomes too wordy, it makes it harder for us to find the information we want and can cause it to become difficult to read. Conciseness will make information quick to find, simple, and easy to understand. Here are some examples of how we can make sentences more concise.

#### Consiseness Sample 1

Turn a sentence like this:

> At this point in time we canâ€™t ascertain the reason as to why the screen door was left open.

into this:

`Right now, we don't know why the screen door was left open.`

#### Consiseness Sample 2

Turn a sentence like this:

> There is a desire on the part of many of us to maintain a spring break for the purpose of getting away from the demands of our studies.

into this:

`We want to continue spring break to avoid studying.`
