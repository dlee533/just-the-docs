| **Symptoms** | **Probable Cause** | **Action** |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ---------- |
| Option to generate a unit test isn't showing | Didn't click on or highlight the function name | Click on or highlight the function name before trying to generate the unit test file |
| The file I want to commit doesn't appear on Commit Changes window | You have not staged the file or didn't make any change to the file after your last commit | Follow the adding files instruction (remember to link!!!) |
| My Git repository is public | You have not checked off the checkbox for privacy setting | Go to github, login with your id, and manually change the privacy setting in settings tab |
| My unittest fails every time | You have not changed the initial unittest file, the first test cases are written to fail at all times | Edit or delete the initial test case on generated unittest file |
