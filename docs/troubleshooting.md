| **Symptoms** | **Probable Cause** | **Action** |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ---------- |
| I cannot view the option to generate a unit test | You did not click on or highlight the function name | [Click on or highlight the function name before trying to generate the unit test file](../task2.md/) |
| The file I want to commit doesn't appear on Commit Changes window | You have not staged the file or didn't make any change to the file after your last commit | Follow the [adding files instruction](https://dlee.ca/user-documentation/docs/task3/)|
| My Git repository is public | You have not checked off the checkbox for privacy setting | Go to github, login with your id, and manually change the privacy setting in settings tab |
| My unittest fails every time | You have not changed the initial unittest file, the first test cases are written to fail at all times | Edit or delete the initial test case on generated unittest file |
| I cannot add the files to my local Git Repository | You have not initialized the git repository on right directory | Delete the current repository and create another at an appropriate level |
