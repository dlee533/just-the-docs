## Create a local git repository
Version control allows the programmer to view their progress and easily revert to the previous version when required. In order to enable version control, you first need to create a local Git repository.

By using PyCharm's Git integeration, you can create a local git repository with easy-to-understand graphical user interface.

1. Click ```VCS``` on the menu bar
2. Click ```Import into Version Control```
3. Click ```Create Git Repository```
4. Choose a destination folder for your Git repository
5. Click ```Ok``` at the bottom

## Connecting to GitHub
Once you finished setting up the local Git repository, you can control the versions and share the repository with others using GitHub.

PyCharm's Git integration removes the need to understand git command used on command line interface (Command Prompt for Window) making it ideal for someone learning the basics of Git and GitHub.

1. Click ```VCS```
2. Click ```Import into Version Control```
3. Click ```Share Project on GitHub```
4. Log in using GitHub id and password
5. Set repository name and privacy level
6. Click ```share```
